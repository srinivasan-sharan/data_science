# data_science
A repo to track my journey in the vast field of data science


1) Learnt about numpy and how it adds more mathematical functionality to python.

2) Learnt about pandas and its importance in data analysis as it helps provide the framework required to analyze data and help make sense of it. We also learnt how to extract certain features from the given datasets.

3) Learnt about matplotlib, a library used to visialize the data we have thus far analyzed.
